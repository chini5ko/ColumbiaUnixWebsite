                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p id="smallBio"> &nbsp; I was born on planet Earth, in "Isla de Margarita" , Venezuela. Actually, my parents and their ancestors are from China but traveled a couple of continents settling down in South America as the Spanish did in 1450. Thanks to the Spanish, I learned their language that was passed down after their colonization in Venezuela. On the island, I spoke to my parents in Cantonese , which language has more than 3000 years of history. 
                    In history class, I learned that England colonized the North . I moved to learn the language of English in New York City, where my college adventure started!
                        
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp; As you can see, I am studying at Columbia University in the City of New York the major of Computer Science. Also, I have an associate degree in Business Administration that I received at BMCC. I chose these two majors because as a kid I saw the intersection between technology and business when my parents implemented a computer register for the store's items; thus, the store productivity increases thanks to the integration of software and hardware .
                        Knowing the computer history, which is very short, I am open to explore more fields related to technology, algorithms, and even creativity. </p>
